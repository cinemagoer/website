After cloning the repository, install the prerequisites:

```
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the live development server:

```
bash

lektor server
```

Browse to the reported URL.

Edit the files and see the results in the browser.
Don't use the admin panel (the pencil button) if you're not
familiar with lektor.

When you're done, push your changes and Travis will automatically
build and deploy the site. If you don't want to trigger a build
include the text `[skip ci]` on a separate line in the commit message.
